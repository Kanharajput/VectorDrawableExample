# VectorDrawableExample
Drawable Animation is also there checkout the documentation of android. but that is not vector so it blur or not go as good as this.     
Use shapeShifter it will make our work easy. Just drag and drop vector drawabal and one can apply property animtion over it also we 
can morph the path and if there is any conflict between coordinates it will automatically sort it out. 
After that we can simple download the AnimatedVectorDrawable file and put it inside Drawable 
after that set this drawable using setImageResource method and also set drawable in xml resources.
